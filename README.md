1.  Mahanolobis distance: It is used when independent variable are correlated. And hence, in that situation Euclidian distance would not work.  So we use Mahanolobis distance. 
It is measurement based on 2 points variance and the centre point of the dimension. 
It can be used to measure distances eve in 3, 4, n dimension space. 

2.	Before any model selection, especially take plot between variables – Check if points are NO overlaps (for class 0 and 1) then you can use linear or logistic regression or basically regression technique. 
If there is mix and overlap – use KNN method because Knn goes for Euclidian distance and can predict class accordingly. 

3.	You can plot Bar chart with R, with table () plus also box plot (class wise like male & Female) with the use of table ().

4.	OLS – Ordinary Least Squared Method (in Regression) – least squares: minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (values of the variable being observed) in the given dataset and those predicted by the linear function.


5.	Residuals = Actual – predicted

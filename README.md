Data Sceince concepts notes for refrence


1.  Mahanolobis distance: It is used when independent variable are correlated. And hence, in that situation Euclidian distance would not work.  So we use Mahanolobis distance. 
It is measurement based on 2 points variance and the centre point of the dimension. 
It can be used to measure distances eve in 3, 4, n dimension space. 

2.	Before any model selection, especially take plot between variables – Check if points are NO overlaps (for class 0 and 1) then you can use linear or logistic regression or basically regression technique. 
If there is mix and overlap – use KNN method because Knn goes for Euclidian distance and can predict class accordingly. 

3.	You can plot Bar chart with R, with table () plus also box plot (class wise like male & Female) with the use of table ().

4.	OLS – Ordinary Least Squared Method (in Regression) – least squares: minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed dependent variable (values of the variable being observed) in the given dataset and those predicted by the linear function.


5.	Residuals = Actual – predicted 

6.	What is Statistic? How to use: IN real world when we do experiment for example if want to measure Swatch Bharat Abhiyan impact in rural sanitation. Then we can’t take data from every villages (cost involved). So, we take sample, let’s say 20 village (choosing right sampling method). And we run statistics – Descriptive stats (mean medium mode, relationship) and Inferential Stats (ANOVA, t-test, Hypothesis). And we can come to conclusion Perspective stats How Swatch Bharat worked in villages and what needs to improve.  

7.	P-value: less the p-value mean less often we expect the result/value, if Null Hypothesis is true. Hence, in hypothesis we try to reduce p-value (< 0.05) and hence, proved that the value occurrence is less and based on that we reject the Null. And Alternate Hypo approved.
